# YouTube Comment Scraper + Sentiment Analyzer

## The Sentiment Analyzer

After a scrape, "Send to Analyzer" carries the result straight into `/analyze` in memory — no
re-upload. Manual upload of a §3.1 comments CSV or the scraper's native JSON also works
standalone (via "Or analyze an existing comments export"). Either path: pick a purpose + a
client, run, get a Markdown report + `summary.json` back.

**Adding a purpose or client is drop-a-file + redeploy** — no code change:
- New purpose: add `sentiment/engine/purposes/<purpose_id>.md` (see an existing one for the
  frontmatter + fenced ```yaml block shape). Mark `status: stub` until it's proven.
- New client: add `sentiment/engine/clients/<client_slug>.md` the same way.
- Both dropdowns self-populate from these folders (`GET /sentiment/options`).

**Going live (the model call is currently gated dark):**
1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the backend service's Railway variables (and confirm
   `SENTIMENT_MODEL` / `SENTIMENT_MAX_TOKENS` if you want non-defaults).
2. That's it — `sentiment/run.py::analyze()` checks `os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")` and
   switches from the `not_enabled` stub to the real call automatically. No code change needed.
3. **Before exposing this to anyone outside the team:** the live endpoint spends API money per
   run — add a shared access-code gate in front of `/analyze` first (not yet built; see
   `sentiment-analyzer-BUILD-HANDOFF.md` §12).

## Deploying on Railway (two services)

Create **two separate services** in the same Railway project, both pointing at this repo.

### 1. Backend service
- **Root Directory:** `/` (repo root — leave default)
- **Variables:** `YOUTUBE_API_KEY = <your key>` (required); `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `SENTIMENT_MODEL` / `SENTIMENT_MAX_TOKENS` (optional — analyzer stays stubbed until
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set)
- Railway auto-detects Python via `requirements.txt` and starts it with the `Procfile`:
  `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- After deploy, note the public URL, e.g. `https://yt-backend.up.railway.app`
- Health check: `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok","key_loaded":true}`

### 2. Frontend service
- **Root Directory:** `frontend`
- **Variables:** `VITE_BACKEND_URL = https://<your-backend-url>` (no trailing slash)
  - ⚠️ This is read at **build time** — set it before the build, and redeploy if it changes.
- Railway auto-detects Node via `package.json`, runs `npm run build`, then serves
  the static `dist/` with `serve` (see `frontend/Procfile`).

## Local development

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py                      # http://localhost:5000

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env               # VITE_BACKEND_URL defaults to localhost:5000
npm install
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:5173
```
